        I made this website as a project for the W&B club of IIT Madras, of
        which I am now a Deputy Coordinator. It also makes a lot of sense to
        have self-intro website, doesn't it? Well, lets see if I can bring this
        one to life with whatever I have learnt thus far.<br />
        I am Bala Nithin M S, an undergraduate student in Aerospace Engineering
        at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, with a growing interest
        in fluid mechanics and research at the intersection of Physics and
        Aerospace. I enjoy combining my curiosity for science and technology
        with hands-on work in coding, 3D design, and student clubs on campus.

            I was born and brought up in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, and I currently
            live in Chennai with my parents. I completed my schooling at The
            Camford International School (TCIS), where I developed a strong
            inclination towards the sciences and participated actively in
            academic pursuits.

            Within aerospace, I have recently become particularly interested in
            fluid mechanics and aerodynamics, and I am keen on exploring these
            areas in greater depth through coursework and future research
            projects. During school, I secured a good state-level rank in the
            Biology Olympiad, which strengthened my interest in core science
            subjects and analytical problem-solving.

            I have a reasonable command of C and Python and have recently
            started learning C++, along with experience in HTML and CSS and an
            ongoing effort to improve my JavaScript skills. I also work with CAD
            and 3D design tools such as Fusion 360 and Tinkercad, and I built a
            simple drone prototype in middle school, which first sparked my
            interest in engineering and making.

            I am an active member of several student communities at IIT Madras,
            including the WebOps and Blockchain Club at CFI, where students work
            on web development and blockchain-based software with real-world
            impact. I am also part of Horizon, the Physics and Astronomy
            society, the Mathematics Club, and the 3D Printing Club, all of
            which allow me to explore physics, mathematics, and prototyping in a
            collaborative environment.

            Outside academics and technical work, I am an avid reader,
            especially of historical fiction and fantasy, and I am currently
            immersed in Sarah J. Maas' Throne of Glass series. I also enjoy
            playing badminton and swimming, which help me maintain a balanced
            routine and unwind after intense academic and club activities.
